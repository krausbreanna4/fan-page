        <h1>Cool Cats</h1>
        <h2>Cats are cool, cats are life.</h2>
        <p>Do you ever sit down and wonder to yourself, why are cats so cool and why don't I have one? Well, if you answered yes to that question, you've come to the right page... if you answered no, then this page will be sure to change your mind... The first and most important reason... <span class="jellyBeans">jelly beans.</span> Yes, thats right, I said jelly beans... If you look under their paw, you'll see four little jelly beans covered in fur. Two, they're your own personal alarm clock. Need to get up at 7 A.M.? They're guarenteed to wake you up two hours earlier! The thrid reason and certainly not the last, they live the life you want to live, they eat, sleep, poop, and repeat. How can you not like cats? </p>
